# A MATLAB Framework for Probabilistic Measures of Coherence and Bayesian Confirmation

This repo contains a simple MATLAB framework for the calculation of probabilistic measures of coherence and Bayesian confirmation. 

The framework was introduced in the following publication: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10670-015-9734-1

A penultimate version of the paper can be found here: https://github.com/jottemka/probabilistic_coherence/blob/main/evaluating.pdf

## Content

The framework consists of 3 functions:

1. `coh(X,pr)`
2. `sup(x,y,pr)`
3. `ams(X,pr)`
